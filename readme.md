# HoloprotRep: Protein Representation Classification

- HoloprotRep aims to construct models for protein function prediction Holoprotrep can concate protein representations in to prepare datasets  for training and testing models


# How to run HoloprotRep 

Step by step operation:
  1. Clone repostory
  2. Install dependencies(given below)
  3. Download datasets,unzip and place the folder
  4. Edit the configuration file (according to classification methods, for binary classification: **holoprotRep_binary_label_config.yaml** for multi label classification: **holoprotRep_multi_label_config.yaml**) by changing parameters as desired and setting paths of your file(s)
  5. cd intoholoprotrep run **HoloProtRep_binary_label.py** or **HoloProtRep_multi_label.py**
- i.e., python **HoloProtRep_binary_label.py**

# Dependencies
 1.	Python 3.7.3
 2.	pandas 1.1.4
 3.	scikit-learn 0.22.1.
 4.	Scikit-MultiLearn

- Example of binary classification configuration file see documentation [binary_classification.md](binary_classification.md), for example of multilabel classification see documentation [multilabel_classification.md](multilabel_classification.md)
